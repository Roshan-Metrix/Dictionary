# Dictionary App

This is a simple dictionary app created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Overview

This app allows users to search for the meanings of words. Users can input a word in the search box, and the app fetches the definition and example sentences from an online dictionary API. If the word is found, it displays the meaning; otherwise, it shows an error message.
